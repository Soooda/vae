# Variational  Autoencoder
This repo contains my reproduction of the base VAE paper in Pytorch. This model is using **MNIST** dataset.

Run `python train.py -h` to find exact flags you can set to kick start the training.

Run `python evaulate.py -h` to find exact flags you can set to use the trained model to generate new data.
